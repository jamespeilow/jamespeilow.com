## Summary

For this project I created a responsive site with minimalist aesthetic styling that displays a random quote about minimalism.

This project was an early project built to complete the Build a Quote Machine project on FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Setup

- Quotes are stored in a quotes.json file and fetched on page load, with a random quote selected
- Quotes are updated when the New Quote button is selected
- Twitter Tweet intent URL used to allow for easy tweeting of the quote with the #minimalism hashtag.

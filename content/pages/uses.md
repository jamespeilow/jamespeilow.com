Inspired by Wes Bos’s /uses page, and the [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) site, here’s my uses page.

## Editor

- Visual Studio Code - I've been using VS Code since around 2018. Before that I was using Coda by Panic
- Usually using the [Lucy](https://github.com/juliettepretot/lucy-vscode-theme) theme, but recently started using the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code) theme
- I went through a phase of trying every new font I came across, but I've settled on [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

## Software

- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html) with [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) prompt
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) with the Powerpack - I've been using Alfred for years, and I'm constantly using the web search shortcuts, clipboard history and snippets.
- Figma
- Firefox Developer Edition
- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) - a great cross-platform Git client. It's got a great diff viewer and really helpful for visually checking merge conflicts and git history on complex projects.
- Google Chrome - My main daily browser
  - [PixelParallel by htmlBurger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob?hl=en) for checking builds against designs
  - Vue.js Dev Tools
  - Pesticide

- [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/) for local Wordpress & PHP development
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- Slack
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - window management app (though no longer actively maintained)
- Spotify
- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) (RIP Wunderlist)

## Phone Setup

I keep a pretty minimal setup on my iPhone11 with just have one home screen set up (thanks iOS14!), and I don't have tons of apps on my phone. Some of my favourite apps are:

- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) journalling
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/the_astronaut/?hl=en)
- Pocket
- Notion
- Spark email client
- Spotify
- TickTick
- [Been](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/been/id680148327) to keep track of the countries I've visited
